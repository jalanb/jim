Just Play Music


Rationale
---------

My library is too big, so I'm not interested in playlists, or folders. I don't want to have to choose, just play music. I'll show you the root directory to the library. There it is: play it.

Interfaces
----------

I spend my day in bash, Python and Firefox, so if I can use it from there, fine by me.

There are already many great apps to handle the rest:
 * ~~make the noises with mpd or mplayer~~ Use [music-player][mp], [This guy][guy] [gets it][it]!
 * edit the sounds with Audacity or Fission
 * edit the tags with MusicBrainz or TriTag
 * show the album art in Firefox or gimp, or even display

That'll do, pig.
